    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The best chocolate chip cookies you'll ever eat. Period. End of story.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>4 oz milk or semi sweet chocolate chunks</li>
            <li>4 oz dark chocolate chunk, or your preference</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
    <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</li>
    <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</li>
    <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more comple</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
    <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
    <li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
